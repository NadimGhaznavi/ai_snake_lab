## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Added formatting for large numbers to the *stored games* and *highscores game number*.
- Added a *Tabbed Plots* widget.
  - Moved the *Game Score* plot widget into the new *Tabbed Plots* widget.
  - Added a *Highscores* plot.
  - Added a *Loss* plot.
- Based on the shiny new *Loss* plot, tuned the *learning rate* for the linear and RNN models.
- Added a *Learning Rate* input to the *configuration settings*.
  - Wired the sane default learning rate values (based on the model selection) so that the correct one is loaded when the *Defaults* button is pressed.
  - Modified the `AITrainer` to capture the loss at the end of each *train step* and return an average of these values at the end of an epoch with a new `get_epoch_loss()` function.
- Added additional constants to the `DLabels` and `Dlayouts` files to support the new features.

### Removed
- Removed the `LabPlot` widget. It has been replaced by the new `TabbedPlots` widget.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- Show the number of frames for the *long training phase*, when `mem_type` is *random frames*.

### Fixed
- Increased width so *Random Frames* isn't truncated.
- Fixed SQL bug in `ReplayMemory:get_random_frames()`.

### Changed
- Changed the *highscores* layout so there's a space between the scrollbar and the seconds.
- Set the *stored games* back to zero when the *restart* button is pressed
- Clear the data from the *games* and *frames* SQLite3 tables when the *restart* button is pressed.
- Format the number of stored games (add commas) when they are large.

---

## [0.8.0] - 2025-10-13

### Changed
- Linear Model, `ModelL`, changes:
  - Formatting improvement of the highscores.
  - Increased the linear model's (`ModelL`) learning rate.
  - Added an additional hidden layer to the linear model.
  - Decreased the dropout value from 0.2 to 0.1.

---

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-13 

### Added
- Added a *Time* column to the *Highscores*
- A screenshot of the TUI to the website.

### Changed
- Plotting Widget:
  - Renamed the plotting widget from `Db4EPlot` to `LabPlot`
  - Removed the code that averaged results since I'm using a sliding method instead.
- Added a *target model* that keeps a frozen copy of the main network. This prevents *chasing moving targets* instability issues.
- Added a *soft update* (Ï„=0.01) to blend weights in slowly. This smooths the learning curve.
- Replaced MSE with Huber loss. It's less sensitive to large TD errors (outliers).
- Added *gradient clipping* to prevents exploding gradients.
- Added an update frequency (target_update_freq=100) to sync target every ~100 frames
- Vectorize the data coming out of the ReplayMemory leading to a **HUGE** improvement in speed.
- Adjust gradients on the batch, not single frames for *better* learning and smoother gradients
- Return the loss for future plotting.


### Fixed
- Cleared the *Plot Widget* when the *Restart* button is pressed
- Reset the neural network model's learned weights when the *Restart* button is pressed.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added
- Added a `DColors` constants file.
- Updated website content.
  - Added *Schema*, *Constants*, *Project Layout*, *Git Branching* and *Git Commit* technical documents.
  - Added a *Richard Sutton* page.
- ReplayMemory exposes the current training game ID:
  - Modified the `ReplayMemory` to return the stored game and frame IDs.
  - Modified the `AIAgent` to first load the training data, get the training game ID, then train.
  - Modified `AISim` to get the training game ID from teh `AIAgent` and display it in the TUI.

### Changed
- Set the *learning rate* in the `AITrainer`, based on the selected *model*.

### Refactor
- Made handling and definition of constants consistent.
- Renamed the `DDb4ePlot` constants file to `DPlot`

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- Added a highscores widget showing the game number and the high score.
- Reworked the state map in `GameBoard:get_state()`
- Moved the `ModelRNN` model parameters into the `DModelRNN` constants file.
- Updated the *SQLite* schema used by the `ReplayMemory` class.
  - See https://snakelab.osoyalce.com/db_schema.html
- Added drop down menu to select the `ReplayMemory` type i.e. *Random Game*, *Random Frames* or *None*.
    - Added a runtime widget to display the current memory type
- Added sections to the website / README file.
- Added a [Richard Sutton](https://snakelab.osoyalce.com//richart_sutton.html) page.
