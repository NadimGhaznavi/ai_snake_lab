# üíª Installation

This project is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ai-snake-lab/). You can install the *AI Snake Lab* software using `pip`.

## Create a Sandbox 

```shell
python3 -m venv snake_venv
. snake_venv/bin/activate
```

## Install the AI Snake Lab

After you have activated your *venv* environment:

```shell
pip install ai-snake-lab
```

---

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the AI Snake Lab

You need three terminals to run the **AI Snake Lab**. One terminal for the `SimServer`, one for the `SimRouter`, and one for the `SimClient`.

Lanching the simulation server:

```shell
sim-server
```

Lanching the simulation router:

```shell
sim-router
```

Launching the simulation client:

```shell
sim-client
```

# üôè Acknowledgements

The original code for this project was based on a YouTube tutorial, [Python + PyTorch + Pygame Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Train an AI to Play Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds) by Patrick Loeber. You can access his original code [here](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch) on GitHub. Thank you Patrick!!! You are amazing!!!! This project is a port of the pygame and matplotlib solution.

Thanks also go out to Will McGugan and the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) team. Textual is an amazing framework. Talk about *Rapid Application Development*. Porting this from a Pygame and MatPlotLib solution to Textual took less than a day.

# üåü Inspiration

Creating an artificial intelligence agent, letting it loose and watching how it performs is an amazing process. It's not unlike having children, except on a much, much, much smaller scale, at least today! Watching the AI driven Snake Game is mesmerizing. I'm constantly thinking of ways I could improve it. I credit Patrick Loeber for giving me a fun project to explore the AI space.

Much of my career has been as a Linux Systems administrator. My comfort zone is on the command line. I've never worked as a programmer and certainly not as a front end developer. [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), as a framework for building rich *Terminal User Interfaces* is exactly my speed and when I saw [Dolphie](https://github.com/charles-001/dolphie), I was blown away. Built-in, real-time plots of MySQL metrics: Amazing! 

Richard S. Sutton is also an inspiration to me. His thoughts on *Reinforcement Learning* are a slow motion revolution. His criticisms of the existing AI landscape with it's focus on engineering a specific AI to do a specific task and then considering the job done is spot on. His vision for an AI agent that does continuous, non-linear learning remains the next frontier on the path to *General Artificial Intelligence*.
